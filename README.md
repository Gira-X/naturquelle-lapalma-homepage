# NaturQuelle La Palma

This is the German website for our permaculture project in Las Tricias, La Palma.

## Compilation

[PugJS](https://pugjs.org) is used to compile the `.pug` files which output to HTML files.

The HTML files are also uploaded to make use of GitHub Pages.

#### Open Source and Permaculture

We feel those principles have to go hand-in-hand, so we strive to create everything as
open source as possible.

The website is hosted on InfinityFree.
