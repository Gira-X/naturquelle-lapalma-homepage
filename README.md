# NaturQuelle La Palma

This is the German website for our permaculture project in Las Tricias, La Palma.

All of our offers are on a donation base and we have seen that living even a few days in a natural environment does wonders to creativity and inspiration and we would love to share the gift to everyone!

#### Short link

You can use this link to quickly access the website: [TODO]()

Because the Github docs link is very long by itself, we use a URL shortening service.

## Compilation

[PugJS](https://pugjs.org) is used to compile the `.pug` files which output to HTML files.

The HTML files are also uploaded to make use of GitHub Pages.

## Attributions

The font in the top logo is Gabriola.

The vector icons (github, facebook, email, phone) are all from www.materialdesignicons.com

Feel free to copy, share and use everything as you like!

#### Open Source and Permaculture 

We feel those 2 principles have to go hand-in-hand, so we strive to create everything as open source as possible.

This is also a way for us to save money on web-hosting solutions.
